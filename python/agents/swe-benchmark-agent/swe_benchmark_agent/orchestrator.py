            (7) To make multiple edits to the same file, stack a series of concise *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
            (8) Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
            (9) The search parts in different *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks should not overlap.
            (10) Do not put any code lines outside of *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

            <<<<<<< SEARCH

                        You are trying to submit your work, but before that, please carefully verify that you have performed the following steps as described in your instructions:

                        1. You have **thoroughly** tested your solution by creating two comprehensive tests covering different edge cases. If you only tested the main functionality so far, you should create another test with more comprehensive test cases. Do **NOT** split existing tests into two seperate tests to satisfy this requirement. You have to create new tests from scratch if needed.

                        2. Regression tests: You have run any **existing** related tests in the repository besides your newly created tests to make sure your changes do not regress or break anything.
                            - **Very important:** Make sure you also run a broader set of existing tests, not just the ones in the same test files you edited.
                            - If there is a regression, be rigourous and fix it. Also update existing tests if necessary.
                            - You should **NEVER** give up fixing the issue if the regression is related to your changes.

                        Make sure you have completed all the above steps before submitting your work. If you have completed all the above steps, call the submit tool again. Otherwise, go back and perform the missing steps.

                        Remember, You should use as many tool calls as possiblle, ideally more than 100 steps of tool calls, you only used {self.turn_count} tool calls so far."""
